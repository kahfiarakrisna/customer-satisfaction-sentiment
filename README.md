✈️ Customer Satisfaction Performance Analysis – Airline Dataset
📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes airline customer satisfaction to evaluate overall service performance and identify key drivers behind negative sentiment and low Net Promoter Score (NPS).
The analysis focuses on customer feedback across different service attributes, cabin classes, and travel types. The objective is to uncover actionable insights that can help improve customer experience, increase satisfaction (CSAT), and reduce detractors.
This project simulates a real-world airline performance evaluation scenario where customer sentiment directly impacts brand reputation and customer loyalty.
📊 Dataset Information
Industry: Airline / Aviation
Unit of Analysis: 1 row = 1 passenger feedback record
Key Variables:
Customer demographics
Type of travel (Business / Personal)
Cabin class (Business / Eco / Eco Plus)
Service ratings (seat comfort, inflight service, baggage handling, food & drink, etc.)
Satisfaction category (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
NPS category (Promoter / Passive / Detractor)
🎯 Business Objective
Measure overall customer satisfaction performance.
Identify which services contribute most to negative sentiment.
Compare satisfaction performance by cabin class and type of travel.
Understand the relationship between CSAT and NPS.
📈 Key Metrics Analyzed
Total Customers: 100,000
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT): 43.3%
Net Promoter Score (NPS): -67.0%
Sentiment Distribution
Positive: 14.69%
Negative: 81.70%
🔎 Key Insights
1️⃣ Overall Satisfaction is Critically Low
The airline shows a negative NPS (-67%), indicating a significantly higher number of detractors than promoters. This suggests serious service quality issues affecting customer loyalty.
2️⃣ Negative Sentiment Dominates
Over 80% of customers fall into the negative sentiment category. This highlights a systemic service problem rather than isolated incidents.
3️⃣ Cabin Class Performance Gap
Business class performs better in CSAT compared to Economy and Eco Plus.
Economy segments show the lowest satisfaction and most negative NPS.
This indicates service quality inconsistency across price tiers.
4️⃣ Travel Type Differences
Business travelers have higher CSAT compared to personal travelers.
Personal travel customers show extremely low NPS.
This suggests different expectation levels and experience perceptions between segments.
5️⃣ Services with Highest Negative Impact
Service attributes contributing most to dissatisfaction include:
Inflight service
Baggage handling
Seat comfort
On-board service
Leg room service
Operational and comfort-related services appear to be primary pain points.
🧠 What I Learned
How to calculate and interpret CSAT and NPS in a real business context.
How to segment customer satisfaction by categorical dimensions (class & travel type).
How to identify service-level drivers behind negative sentiment.
How to translate dashboard metrics into business recommendations.
The importance of combining sentiment analysis with structured rating metrics.
This project strengthened my ability to move beyond visualization into actionable business storytelling.
