## 🔎 Key Insights

### 1️⃣ Overall Performance is Critically Low
The airline records a negative NPS (-67%), indicating that detractors significantly outnumber promoters. This reflects serious customer experience challenges.

### 2️⃣ Negative Sentiment Dominates
Over 80% of customers express negative sentiment, suggesting systemic service issues rather than isolated incidents.

### 3️⃣ Cabin Class Performance Gap
- Business Class shows higher CSAT compared to Economy segments.
- Economy and Eco Plus show significantly lower NPS.

This indicates service quality inconsistency across pricing tiers.

### 4️⃣ Travel Type Differences
- Business travelers demonstrate higher satisfaction.
- Personal travel customers show extremely low NPS.

Different expectations and service experiences may explain this gap.

### 5️⃣ Services Driving Dissatisfaction
Top contributors to negative sentiment include:
- Inflight Service
- Baggage Handling
- Seat Comfort
- On-board Service
- Leg Room Service

Operational and comfort-related factors are the primary pain points.
